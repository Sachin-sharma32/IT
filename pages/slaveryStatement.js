                        Modern slavery is a violation of human rights and is
                        defined as any conduct that involves the recruitment,
                        movement, or exploitation of a person for financial or
                        personal gain. We do not tolerate any form of modern
                        slavery within our organization and supply chain and
                        have put in place measures to prevent and detect it.

                        We have a zero-tolerance policy towards modern slavery
                        and are committed to ensuring that all of our employees
                        and suppliers uphold this policy. We also ensure that
                        our policies, procedures, and training are up-to-date
                        and aligned with the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015.

                        regular risk assessments of our supply chain to identify
                        and address any potential risks. Our risk assessment
                        considers the countries of origin of our suppliers, the
                        sectors they operate in, and the nature of the goods and
                        services they provide.

                        tackling modern slavery, and we conduct regular checks
                        to ensure compliance. We also include anti-slavery and
                        human trafficking clauses in our contracts with our
                        suppliers.
