            Modern slavery is a violation of human rights and is dfined as any
            conduct that involves the recruitment, movement, or exploitation of
            a person for financial or personal gain. We do not tolerate any form
            of modern slavery within our organization and supply chain and have
            put in place measures to prevent and detect it.
          </p>

            We have a zero-tolerance policy towards modern slavery and are
            committed to ensuring that all of our employees and suppliers uphold
            this policy. We also ensure that our policies, procedures, and
            training are up-to-date and aligned with the UK Modern Slavery Act
            of 2015.

            We acknowledge that modern slavery can occur at any stage of the
            supply chain, and therefore, we conduct regular risk assessments of
            our supply chain to identify and address any potential risks. Our
            risk assessment considers the countries of origin of our suppliers,
            the sectors they operate in, and the nature of the goods and

            compliance. We also include anti-slavery and human trafficking
